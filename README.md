# Predicting-LGBTQI-Hate-Crimes-in-the-U.S.-Using-Machine-Learning


## Project Overview: 
~Brief description of the project, its goals, and key findings~

In this project, I examined hate crimes against LGBTQI+ individuals in the U.S. from 1991 to 2019, focusing on factors like income inequality, victim counts, LGBTQI+ population size, and anti-LGBTQI+ laws. **Machine learning algorithms** were used to predict and classify these crimes, with an emphasis on evaluating their accuracy. I used different data tools during the elaboration of this study, including **SQL** (for ETL), **R** (EDA and ML) and **Tableau** (Visualizations and Interactive Dashboard).

**Key Strengths**

- **Relevance of Topic:** The project addresses a socially significant issue.

- **Use of ML Algorithms:** I have applied a variety of ML techniques (Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Means, K-NN) to analyze the dataset.

- **Data Enrichment:** I have added external data (e.g., LGBTQI+ population, Gini Index, hate crime laws) to enhance the analysis.

- **Visualizations:** The use of Tableau and Excel for visualizations adds a layer of clarity to the findings.

- **CRISP-DM Methodology:** The structured approach to data mining is a strong point.
